Development of the API (using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB) for 'Mon Vieux Grimoire,' a fictional book rating website. (This project was carried out as part of a web development training)

## Lessons Learned

During the development of this API, I learned how to set up a server using Node.js, master API programming with Express.js by creating the necessary middleware for its proper functioning, organize a coherent and readable folder structure, and create and connect a MongoDB database to my application. This allowed me to explore certain features of Mongoose, such as creating models and managing them within the middleware.
